    "## **Intro to `Spring Framework`**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a `Dependency Injection` framework for building `Java` applications loosely coupled and easily testable. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Dependency Injection (DI)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency Injection is a design pattern that allows the removal of hard-coded dependencies and makes it possible to change them, whether at runtime or compile time. It promotes loose coupling between classes and their dependencies by injecting the required dependencies from outside the class rather than creating them within the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a `Car` class that depends on an `Engine` class. Instead of the `Car` class creating an instance of the `Engine` class directly, the `Engine` instance is injected into the `Car` class from outside, typically through constructor injection or setter injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Car {\n",
    "    private Engine engine;\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Constructor Injection\n",
    "    public Car(Engine engine) {\n",
    "        this.engine = engine;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void start() {\n",
    "        engine.start();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Engine` dependency is injected into the `Car` class through its constructor, allowing for greater flexibility and easier testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, if we do not use DI, the `Car` class would create its own instance of the `Engine` class, leading to tight coupling:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Car {\n",
    "    private Engine engine;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public Car() {\n",
    "        this.engine = new Engine();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void start() {\n",
    "        engine.start();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach makes it difficult to change the `Engine` implementation or to test the `Car` class in isolation.\n"
